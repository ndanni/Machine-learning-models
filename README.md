# Machine-learning-models
This repo contains machine learning models that I built using linear regression, Classification models using pytourch, keras
I uploaded the data to Azure blob storage and connected it to the data from the machine learning studio using different methods.
I employed different machine learning algorithms to build this model: auto ML, python SDK and machine learning pipeline.
Screenshots of the machine learning pipelines are attached to the repo.
