# Machine-learning-models
This repo contains machine learning models that I built using linear regression.
I uploaded the data to azure blob storage and connected to the data from machine learning studio using different methods.
I employed different machine learning algorithms to build this model: auto ML, python SDK and machine learning pipeline.
Screenshots of the machine learning piplelines is attached to the repo.
